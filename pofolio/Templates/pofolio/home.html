                    <p>Throughout my programming life, which is a journey to senior software engineer, I have learnt and implemeted
                       various high level languages that include C, Java, Python, Visual Basics, HTML/CSS and Javascript.
                       I have completed various projects in all different language that include an E-commerce websites that works well 
                       with dropshipping in Python-Django frame work.
                       My learnig journey can be traced back from class, group projects, bootcamps and a lot in personal learning,
                       I believe in hardwork and personal effort to achieving what your desire and deserve in life!

                        Through personal effort I have made robust systems which include a dropshipping website. The experience cuts
                        across Fronted development, Backend and APIs development.

                        I currently study an Kirinyaga University College in Kirinyaga County, Central Kenya. Software Engnieering
                        is the overall course name and the training ground for my studies. Exposure to the outside environment through 
                        atachment and inturnships to companies and organizations have contributed to my career growth.

                        Artificial Intellligence is an upcoming field in the industry where the slogan has been changed to innovate with AI or perish. 
                        That has been a major concer to my studies and learning morden systems have Ai in them means its outdated to do the opposite. 
                        Machine learning has been a contentious issue and thats a journey I am willing to undertake.

                        When I wake up in the morning my first step is to make my bed, I believe a way to room above is a single step up.
                        That's the same journey as long as achiving greater goals is concerned. For every study I ensure extensive research 
                        on subject matter and use equio myself with frameworks for each and every programming language. Combinition of various
                        languages through frameworks has helped to making optimized program softwares.

                    <p>
                        My long term goal is to become a senior software engineer in my own company determined to change 
                        the world with mordern technological advancement in the field of computing.
